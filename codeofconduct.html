<h1>Meetup Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at the Newsgames Meetup are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers (Linda Sandvik and a representative from Mozilla) will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Be excellent with each other</em></p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>Please contact <a href="mailto:linda.sandvik@gmail.com">Linda Sandvik</a> or <a hef="mailto:clord@mozilla.com"Christopher Lord</a> (Mozilla represenative)</p>

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

<p>Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. <strong>NB! Please be aware that for our first meetup, April 14th, there will be a 20 minute talk about "Pornography for Beginners", a newsgame about the changing pornography laws in the UK. This talk is not considered to be in breech of the Code of Conduct as it is not degradory or harsassing, but rather an example of telling a news-story in an interesting way</strong>. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the organisers.</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup with no refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Linda Sandvik or Mozilla staff immediately.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at the meetup and meetup-related social events.</p>
