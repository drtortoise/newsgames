		<h2 id="definition">What is a newsgame?</h2>
		
		<p>Our definition of newsgame is a game that tells a news-story in some way. Newspapers have being doing games for over a century, like crosswords, but these are not really telling a news-story. One of my favourite news-games of all time is Wired’s <a href="http://archive.wired.com/special_multimedia/2009/cutthroatCapitalismTheGame">Cutthroat Capitalism</a>, in which you are a pirate, and have to capture ships off the Somali coast and then negotiate ransoms to get a payout, which you then share with your crew and tribe. A popular newsgame format is the humble choose-your-own-adventure. Some examples of this is BBC’s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-32057601">Syrian Journey</a> and Buzzfeed’s <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tomphillips/can-you-survive-a-week-as-jeremy-corbyn">Can you survive a week as Jeremy Corbyn?</a></p>

<p>The power of games lie in their ability to not just describe but demonstrate how something work. Take vaccinations for example. In the game <a href="http://vax.herokuapp.com/">vax!</a> you play against a pandemic, and soon learn the key to beating it is having more vaccinations at your disposal. Before playing Cutthroat Capitalism I assumed pirates would always try to get the biggest Maersk ship with the most value cargo, but after playing it for a while I discovered that since all human life is worth something, attacking a lot of small ships and getting loads of small ransoms is much more profitable. It was then much easier for me to understand the rise in piracy in the accompanying news article. </p>
